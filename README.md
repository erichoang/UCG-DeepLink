# UGC-DeepLink

This repository is an official implementation of the UGC-DeepLink model of the "Entity Matching Across Small Networks Using Node Attributes" paper.

The implementation of ISORank and NetAlign was originated from [this repository](https://github.com/constantinosskitsas/Framework_GraphAlignment). We maintained the fundamantal structure of this implementation with bugs fixed. We also added the baseline for the TF-IDF method in `tf_idf.py`.

For the anonymity reason, we hide the original data before the anonymous review phase ends.
